#digiDown - digital file sharing site

From a [tutorial](https://github.com/flaviocopes/bootcamp-2022-week-13-digital-downloads) by [Flavio Copes](https://github.com/flaviocopes)

-   homepage listing of all available products
-   log in with Next-Auth to buy and sell
-   upload digital files, add a picture and set your own price
-   pay for products online via Stripe
-   user dashboard displays products listed and purchased

Note: I built this as a tutorial to learn how to set up Stripe payments; the app is not hosted online to prevent users accidentally making payments.
